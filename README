Important!
This program was not build to be used by people other than me. The priority was to
get good results not usability or security. You can use the software but I recommend to fully
understand the sourcecode before using it. The documentation may not reflect the real sourcecode.
I do not warrant for any damage or data loss that this software may do to your system.
Use at your own risk!
